Title: Problem Set 1 Answers

Problem 1.
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.0.1700.77 Safari/537.36

Explanation: I am using Chrome but the user agent is Mozilla/5.0. A quick SO search reveals this dates back to the Netscape/IE days. The parenthesis describe my computing environment - I am on a Macbook with Mavericks running an Intel chip. I would presume the AppleWebKit is some core functioning code for displaying web content. Chrome/32.0.1700.77 is my chrome version. I do not know why Safari is listed at the end.

Problem 2.
I recall either Professor Evans or the tutorial discussing how Rust is built to be very safe. It would make sense for global variables to need special permission to be changed to prevent a race condition, then. In other words, it is for concurrency safety's sake.
